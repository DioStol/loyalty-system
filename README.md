# loyalty-system

- ## Descrption

The loyalty system web service has been created to meet the needs of rewarding the users of a bank with points for each transaction. More specific a user can earn money for each inside transaction.

- 1 pending point for every euro until 5000 euro value of transaction
- 2 pending points for every euro from 5001 euro to 7500 euro value of transaction
- 3 pending points from 7501 euro value of transaction

New pending points become  available points for use at the end of every week if:

-       The customer has spent at least 500 euro that week

-       At least one transaction exists for that customer on every day of the week

-       A user will lose all the points if no transaction was made in the last 5 weeks

A customer can use available points to invest in stocks, forex, or any other investment that would like.
